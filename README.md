# 1. Guessing a number:
### This a fun game that generates a random number (in a certain range) that the user must guess after receiving hints.
For each wrong guess the user makes, they receive extra hints, but at the cost of reducing their final score.
### This project uses the Python random module to generate random numbers.


# 2. Rock Paper Scissors Game
### This project imulates the universally popular game with functions and conditional statements.
This project uses the standard libraryâ€™s random, os, and re modules.
### The idea is to ask the user to make the first move by passing in a character to represent rock, paper, or scissors.
After evaluating the input string, the conditional logic checks for a winner.
